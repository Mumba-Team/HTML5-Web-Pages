## Colors
We've enhanced Bootstrap’s semantic color selection with brighter color variations in order to improve the contrast and accessibility.
## Typography
Shards uses Poppins as its primary typeface for headings and the system’s UI font with a Roboto-first fallback (only on non-Apple devices) for the remaining content.
## Form Controls
All form controls are improved with micro-transitions and shadows that bring depth and improve the overall user experience.
## Using Icons
Form controls can be stylised by utilizing icons from either supported packs. They can be placed inside default or seamlessly integrated input group addons.
## Custom Controls
The default custom form fields are improved and extended. One of the new additions being the toggle switch control.
## Validation
Form validation is also improved to match the new overall form feel, while following the same interaction principles for consistency.
## Sliders
Sliders are also a new custom control and can be integrated almost anywhere with minimal markup (a single element) and extended customisation options via JavaScript.
## Datepickers
Datepickers are also available and similar to slider controls they are very easy to create, being based on a single input element. Datepickers are customisable as well, letting you create complex configurations with range selections for example.
## Cards
We wanted cards to stand out and bring depth without changing their original structure. All of this while allowing them to play well with the other components.
## Buttons
Two new button modifiers are introduced in Shards that allow you to create pill-shaped and squared buttons for both filled and outlined variations for an extended range of possible combinations.
## Progress Bars
In addition to the default styles Shards allows you to adjust the width and add labels to your progress bars.
## Modals
Display confirmation messages, forms or any type of content to your users using beautiful and non-disruptive modals.
## Badges
Badges are similar to buttons and are available in all theme colors with filled and outlined modes and also with three variation styles: rounded, pill-shaped and squared.
Tooltips & Popovers
Don't let your uses guess by attaching tooltips and popoves to any element. Just make sure you enable them first via JavaScript.
## Navbars
Create beautiful, bold and responsive navbars using the same Bootstrap 4 markup structure you already know and love.
